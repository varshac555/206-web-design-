<p style="color:red;font-family:sans-serif;">A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central 
idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic 
unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one 
central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader 
argument.</p>
